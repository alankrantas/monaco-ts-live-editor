# Monaco TypeScript Live Editor

A simple demonstration to configure [`@monaco-editor/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react) into an online TypeScript editor component with IntelliSense support and can execute the script directly in browser using `ts.transpileModule()` and `eval()`.

The React app is created/built by `Vite` and deployed to GitHub Pages using Github Actions (try it [here](https://alankrantas.github.io/monaco-ts-live-editor/)).
