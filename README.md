# Monaco TypeScript Live Editor

> Try it [here](https://alankrantas.github.io/monaco-ts-live-editor/).

A simple demonstration to wrap [`@monaco-editor/react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@monaco-editor/react) into an online TypeScript editor component with IntelliSense support and script execution functionality. The React app is [created/built by Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and deployed to GitHub Pages using Github Actions.

I decided to keep it as simple as possible with minimal CSS styles. I've made a much more complicated version eariler in FST Network documentation's [Logic Code Generator](https://loc-documentation-dev.vercel.app/logic-code-generator).
